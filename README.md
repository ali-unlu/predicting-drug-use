# Predicting drug use
The aim of this project is to utilize machine learning techniques for social science. During this project, I aim to build models for predicting polydrug use, regular cannabis use among population and cannabis use if it would be decriminalized. 

Briefly you will see:
- Survey data preprocessing
- Basic EDA
- Feature selecting 
- Oversampling and downsampling techniques
- ML models
- Validation techniques
- Reporting
